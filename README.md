Automate the Boring Stuff at Work

This is a Python3 script and therefor requires Python3 installed on your computer
https://www.python.org/downloads/


Download the .ZIP and extract it.
*Or copy the raw .py script, skabelon.docx, elever.txt, and requirements.txt file.
You can move all the files into a directory of your choice, but they have to be in the same directory.*

After downloading the files open a command-prompt and change directory (CD) into the directory of the requirements.txt file

#### Open command-prompt
```
win + r
```
Then type "cmd" and press enter

In the command prompt, change directory to the downloaded files

```cmd
cd C:\Users\<username>\Downloads\Automate-the-Boring-Stuff-at-Work-main
``` 

Then install the required packages with pip3
```cmd
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

After that you should be able to run the .py script

#### Running the program
Run the script by dobble clicking on the Elevplaner_copy.py file
It will first ask you what class you wish to create - this is used for the folder name and also as an input for the endividual files.
Then it will ask for a list of names. If you just edited the `elever.txt` file, write `elever.txt` or `elever` and press enter.

```cmd
Hvilken klasse?: 7b
Filnavn p√• liste af elever?: elever
```
