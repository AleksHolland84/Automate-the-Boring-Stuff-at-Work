After that you should be able to run the .py script

Run the script by dobel clicking on the Elevplaner_copy.py file
It will first ask you what class you wish to create - this is used for the folder name and also as an input for the endividual files.
Then it will ask for a list of names. If you just edited the elever.txt file, write elever.txt or elever and press enter.

```cmd
Hvilken klasse?: test
